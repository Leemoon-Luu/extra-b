# Mini Portfolio – Extra-B Static Multipage Website

This project is a simple static personal portfolio website created for the Extra-B task of the mini-portfolio.

## Structure

- `index.html` – Homepage with a tagline and short introduction.
- `about.html` – Personal bio, profile image, and key skills.
- `projects.html` – At least three project cards with images, descriptions, and “Details” buttons.
- `contact.html` – Contact details with simple icons.
- `styles.css` – Shared stylesheet for all pages.
- `assets/` – Folder for images and favicon.
  - `profile.jpg` – Profile picture.

## Features

- Unified navigation bar on all pages with active page highlighting.
- Responsive layout using flexbox and CSS grid.
- Basic SEO:
  - Page titles set for each HTML file.
  - `<meta name="description">` included on every page.
  - Favicon linked via `assets/favicon.png`.
- Clean visual style with consistent color palette, spacing, and typography.

## How to Run

1. Place all files in the same folder structure.
2. Add your own images to the `assets/` folder (or rename paths in HTML).
3. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
4. Resize the browser window to check responsive behavior on smaller screens.

## Notes

- No JavaScript is used. This is a pure HTML + CSS static multipage site.
- Text content (name, email, location, descriptions) can be edited directly in the HTML files to match your personal information.
